Arcade Game
===========

This game is quite simple but was created using object-oriented programming! Choose your player and see how high you can get! Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move your character. Try to avoid the bugs, they're evil! When you hit a bug the level resets and the number of bugs resets as well. Check out the files above to see how it works.
